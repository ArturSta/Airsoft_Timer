# Airsoft_Timer
Lithuanian airsoft DEEPSAND and AIRSOFTGAME coordinator teams property.
Software and electrical design by Artur Stankeviƒç a.k.a. No_Nick in coordinator teams.

Project based on STM32 microcontroller. STM32 "Blue Pill" dev board. STM32F103C8T6 chip.

!!! Important note: In this project were used 2 LCD 16x2 screens instead of 1 20x4 screen. This was done becouse we wanted to save money becouse we already had enought 16x2 LCD's.
To reduce amount of code and wires I recommend using 1 LCD 20x4. 

This is 2 version of Timer. First one was with 1 LCD screen in 2 version there are 2 LCD 16x2 screens and 4 buttons for each team.

Librarie timer is created for timer functions.
i2c-lcd librarie is for text printing on lcd screen.

Veliavu_taimeris_v2.0.ioc is CubeMX project file.
